# timer
A timing application for MacOS, Windows and Linux

This application was made by William Wan(WanBoyue) in 2020 in China. The first version of this was not a success, actually. It was totally an error, with so much faults that even William Wan gave this thing up. Later, he saw how useful this thing would be as he usually uses his computer to do most of his work. He picked it up again and rewrote another version, which is this one.

IMPORTANT!!!! MacOS Version v1.2 needs package FIGLET before installation. Install Homebrew or Fink(download platform X11 first) to download figlet. Homebrew's main page: brew.sh. PS: For Linux users, check if figlet is already installed. I suggest your running "yum install figlet" or "sudo apt install figlet" or "sudo apt-get install figlet". JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ALREADY INSTALLED!!!

Compilers: MacOS: clang++ at least 3.5 Windows: TDM-GCC 4.9.2 Linux: not compiled, use command "yum install clang-3.5" or "sudo apt install clang-3.5" or "sudo apt-get install clang-3.5" to install clang++-3.5. And then run command: "clang++-3.5 -o "timer" -lm -O2 -Os -fpermissive -fno-asm -Wall [filename]".
